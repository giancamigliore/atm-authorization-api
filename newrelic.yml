common: &default_settings
  # Agent Enabled
  # Use this setting to disable the agent instead of removing it from the startup command.
  # Default is true.
  agent_enabled: true

  # Set the name of your application as you'd like it show up in New Relic.
  # If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application.
  # Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications)
  # to this application. To report data to more than one application
  # (useful for rollup reporting), separate the application names with ";".
  # For example, to report data to "My Application" and "My Application 2" use this:
  # app_name: My Application;My Application 2
  # This setting is required. Up to 3 different application names can be specified.
  # The first application name must be unique.
  app_name: ueno_teds_atm-server[default]

  application_logging:
    # The agent will automatically forward application logs to New Relic in
    # a format that includes agent metadata for linking them to traces and errors.
    forwarding:
      # When true, application logs will be forwarded to New Relic. The default is true.
      enabled: false

  # User-configurable custom labels for this agent.  Labels are name-value pairs.
  # There is a maximum of 64 labels per agent.  Names and values are limited to 255 characters.
  # Names and values may not contain colons (:) or semicolons (;).

# Application Environments
# ------------------------------------------
# Environment specific settings are in this section.
# You can use the environment to override the default settings.
# For example, to change the app_name setting.
# Use -Dnewrelic.environment=<environment> on the Java startup command line
# to set the environment.
# The default environment is production.

# NOTE if your application has other named environments, you should
# provide configuration settings for these environments here.
